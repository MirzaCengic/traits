R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.2.2 and
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Windows
R 3.2.2 and devel on a virtualbox Windows install.

The package now imports non-base functions explicitly as needed in 
accordance with R-devel changes. In addition, this submission has a 
number of bug fixes that improve package functionality.

Thanks!
